# Flight Options from Costa Rica Trip (December 2025 - January 2026)

## Outbound Flights (Costa Rica → Destination in Late Dec 2025)

_Below are one-way flight options from Costa Rica (primarily San José Juan Santamaría Intl, SJO) to each destination around_ _December 23-25, 2025. We include both the cheapest fares and alternatives that offer fewer stopovers or shorter journey times for better value. Prices are approximate per person in USD._

### San José (Costa Rica) ➔ **Cancún (Mexico)**

- **Direct flights:** Low-cost carrier **Volaris** operates non-stop flights (~2¼ hours). For example, on Dec 22 a direct Volaris flight SJO-CUN was about **\$130**[\[1\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/sjo/cun/san-jose-juan-santamaria-to-cancun.html#:~:text=Cancun,with%20Volaris%20Direct%20from%20%24130). Expect similar pricing on adjacent dates (Dec 23-25) if available.
- **1-stop options:** Legacy airlines require a connection (e.g. **Copa Airlines** via Panama City). These tend to be **slightly higher** in price (often in the ~\$150-\$250 range)[\[2\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/sjo/cun/san-jose-juan-santamaria-to-cancun.html#:~:text=Cancun,Copa%201%20stop%20from%20%24156) but can be useful if direct flights are sold out. For instance, Copa flights with a Panama stop have been listed around **\$156** on certain off-peak dates[\[2\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/sjo/cun/san-jose-juan-santamaria-to-cancun.html#:~:text=Cancun,Copa%201%20stop%20from%20%24156) (holiday pricing may vary).

**Sample Options:**

| **Date (Dec 2025)** | **Airline & Route** | **Stops** | **Price (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 23 (approx) | _Volaris_ - direct SJO ➔ CUN | Non-stop | ~\$130[\[1\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/sjo/cun/san-jose-juan-santamaria-to-cancun.html#:~:text=Cancun,with%20Volaris%20Direct%20from%20%24130) |
| Dec 24 (approx) | _Copa Airlines_ - SJO ➔ PTY ➔ CUN (via Panama City) | 1 stop | ~\$200 (est.)[\[2\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/sjo/cun/san-jose-juan-santamaria-to-cancun.html#:~:text=Cancun,Copa%201%20stop%20from%20%24156) |

**Notes:** No other Costa Rica airports offer non-stop Cancun flights. Connections via Panama or the U.S. (e.g. SJO-Miami-CUN) are available on airlines like Copa, Avianca, or American[\[3\]](https://www.travelocity.com/lp/flights/sjo/ctg/juan-santamaria-intl-to-rafael-nunez-intl#:~:text=Are%20there%20direct%20flights%20from,Airport%20%28CTG) if the non-stop is unavailable.

### San José (Costa Rica) ➔ **Cartagena (Colombia)**

- **Typical routing:** There are _no direct flights_ on this route[\[3\]](https://www.travelocity.com/lp/flights/sjo/ctg/juan-santamaria-intl-to-rafael-nunez-intl#:~:text=Are%20there%20direct%20flights%20from,Airport%20%28CTG). Airlines connect via their hubs - e.g. **Avianca** (via Bogotá), **Copa Airlines** (via Panama City), or **American** (via Miami)[\[3\]](https://www.travelocity.com/lp/flights/sjo/ctg/juan-santamaria-intl-to-rafael-nunez-intl#:~:text=Are%20there%20direct%20flights%20from,Airport%20%28CTG). Travel time is around 5 hours total with one stop.
- **Cheapest option:** Recent fares start at **\$134 one-way**[\[4\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/ctg/san-jose-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,CTG). These low fares are usually on Avianca or Copa with a single stopover. For instance, an Avianca/Copa ticket in this range was found for mid-December.
- **Best value:** Copa's connecting flights via Panama are frequent and convenient. Copa has advertised fares from **\$255** USD (one-way) on this route[\[5\]](https://www.copaair.com/en/flights-from-san-jose-cr-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,24). Avianca's one-stop via Bogotá is similar, often in the low \$200s if booked in advance.

**Sample Options:**

| **Date (Dec 2025)** | **Airline & Route** | **Stops** | **Price (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 23 | _Avianca_ - SJO ➔ BOG ➔ CTG (via Bogotá) | 1 stop | ~\$134[\[4\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/ctg/san-jose-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,CTG) |
| Dec 24-25 | _Copa Airlines_ - SJO ➔ PTY ➔ CTG (via Panama City) | 1 stop | ~\$255[\[5\]](https://www.copaair.com/en/flights-from-san-jose-cr-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,24) |

**Notes:** All these flights include a **layover of about 1-2 hours**. Total travel time ~4.5-6 hours. Wingo (low-cost carrier) also operates in the region - occasionally one can find bargain connecting itineraries (e.g. via Bogotá) in the ~\$120-\$150 range on budget airlines[\[4\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/ctg/san-jose-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,CTG).

### San José (Costa Rica) ➔ **Buenos Aires (Argentina)**

- **Typical routing:** Long-haul journey (~11-15 hours total). Common one-stop connections include **Copa** (via Panama City), **LATAM** (via Lima or Santiago), or **Avianca** (via Bogotá). There are **no non-stops**, but these airlines offer single-connection service[\[6\]\[7\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/eze/san-jose-to-buenos-aires#:~:text=).
- **Cheapest option:** Fares were found from about **\$239 one-way**[\[8\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/eze/san-jose-to-buenos-aires#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,EZE) (likely involving _2 stops_ or longer layovers). This represents a rock-bottom price, possibly on a multi-airline itinerary.
- **Best value (1-stop):** Expect to pay closer to **\$500** for a one-stop flight with a mainstream carrier during the holidays. For example, Avianca's one-stop service (via Bogotá) was around **\$500-\$520** in recent searches[\[9\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/San-Jose-Juan-Santamaria-Intl-SJO/Buenos-Aires-Ministro-Pistarini-EZE#:~:text=SJO). Copa's one-stop via Panama similarly often prices in the upper \$400s to \$600 range.

**Sample Options:**

| **Date (Dec 2025)** | **Airline & Route** | **Stops** | **Price (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 24 | _LATAM/Avianca (mix)_ - SJO ➔ LIM ➔ EZE (via Lima & São Paulo) | 2 stops | ~\$239[\[8\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/eze/san-jose-to-buenos-aires#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,EZE) |
| Dec 25 | _Copa Airlines_ - SJO ➔ PTY ➔ EZE (via Panama City) | 1 stop | ~\$500[\[9\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/San-Jose-Juan-Santamaria-Intl-SJO/Buenos-Aires-Ministro-Pistarini-EZE#:~:text=SJO) |

**Notes:** Given the distance (~5,300 km), most "one-stop" itineraries are near the **shortest possible travel time** (~13 hours). Options with two stops can be much longer but sometimes save money[\[8\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/eze/san-jose-to-buenos-aires#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,EZE). If schedule is flexible, mid-week departures tend to be cheaper on this route[\[10\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/San-Jose-Juan-Santamaria-Intl-SJO/Buenos-Aires-Ministro-Pistarini-EZE#:~:text=The%20average%20price%20of%20all,over%20the%20last%2012%20months).

### San José (Costa Rica) ➔ **Panama City (Panama)**

- **Typical routing:** **Copa Airlines** operates this short hop frequently (under 1½ hours flight time), with **multiple daily non-stops** (SJO to PTY). It's a popular route (~220 flights/week)[\[11\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/sjo/pty/san-jose-juan-santamaria-to-panama-city-tocumen-international.html#:~:text=Direct%20flights%20,the%20cheapest%20time%20to). Avianca also has a direct flight on some days.
- **Cheapest option:** Budget-friendly fares can be extremely low - recently **\$89 one-way** was found by a traveler[\[12\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/San-Jose-Juan-Santamaria-Intl-SJO/Panama-City-Tocumen-Intl-PTY#:~:text=%2489%20Find%20Cheap%20Flights%20from,San%20Jos%C3%A9%20to%20Panama%20City). Such fares might involve booking well in advance or a promotional deal (possibly on Copa or Avianca's lowest classes without luggage).
- **Regular fares:** Generally range **\$130-\$200**. Copa's own site quotes about **\$209** one-way as a typical starting price[\[13\]](https://www.copaair.com/en/flights-from-san-jose-cr-to-panama-city#:~:text=Cheap%20flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,PTY%29%20from%20USD209). Around the holidays, expect towards the higher end of that range if not booked early.

**Sample Options:**

| **Date (Dec 2025)** | **Airline & Route** | **Stops** | **Price (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dec 23 | _Avianca_ - SJO ➔ PTY (direct) | Non-stop | ~\$90[\[12\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/San-Jose-Juan-Santamaria-Intl-SJO/Panama-City-Tocumen-Intl-PTY#:~:text=%2489%20Find%20Cheap%20Flights%20from,San%20Jos%C3%A9%20to%20Panama%20City) |
| Dec 24 or 25 | _Copa Airlines_ - SJO ➔ PTY (direct) | Non-stop | ~\$200[\[13\]](https://www.copaair.com/en/flights-from-san-jose-cr-to-panama-city#:~:text=Cheap%20flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,PTY%29%20from%20USD209) |

**Notes:** Flights between Costa Rica and Panama are **very short** (about 1:15h airborne). Even full-service carriers have relatively low prices here - e.g., Copa includes snacks and checked bag on many fares[\[14\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/San-Jose-Juan-Santamaria-Intl-SJO/Panama-City-Tocumen-Intl-PTY#:~:text=Avianca%27s%20Classic%20fare%20includes%20a,on%20and%20checked%20bag). Liberia (LIR) airport in northern Costa Rica also has service to Panama City, but those flights typically connect via SJO or Managua and are not as convenient.

## Return Flights (Latin America → Israel in Jan 2026)

_For the return legs, we consider one-way flights from Latin America to_ _Israel (Tel Aviv)_ _in the_ _first two weeks of January 2026. These are long-haul routes with no non-stop flights, so all options involve at least one connection (often in Europe or the U.S.). We list both the lowest-budget options and those with fewer stopovers for faster travel._

### Cartagena (Colombia) ➔ **Tel Aviv, Israel**

- **Typical routing:** At least _2 flights_ are required. Common routes include **via Europe** (e.g. Cartagena → Madrid → Tel Aviv on Iberia/Air Europa) or **via North America** (e.g. CTG → Miami → Tel Aviv on American Airlines). Total travel time ~15-20 hours.
- **Cheapest option:** We found one-way fares around **\$560**-**\$580**. For instance, Skyscanner shows a Jan 14 itinerary on LATAM (via a connection in São Paulo) for about **\$561**[\[15\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/ctg/il/cartagena-to-israel.html#:~:text=Tel%20Aviv,Airlines%201%20stop%20from%20%24561). Similarly, Kiwi.com reported fares from ~£464 (≈**\$580**) with 2-3 stops[\[16\]](https://www.kiwi.com/en/cheap-flights/cartagena-colombia/tel-aviv-israel/#:~:text=Cheap%20flights%20from%20Cartagena%20to,Tel%20Aviv%20from%20%C2%A3464). These lowest prices often involve multiple layovers or mixing budget carriers.
- **One-stop "best value":** A one-stop route (usually connecting in Europe) typically costs a bit more. Expect roughly **\$750-\$850**. For example, flying **Air Europa/Iberia via Madrid** or **KLM via Amsterdam** falls in this range. (Expedia lists about **\$773** one-way for Tel Aviv-Cartagena[\[17\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/tlv/ctg/tel-aviv-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Tel%20Aviv,on%20top%20of%20our%20rewards), implying similar pricing for the reverse direction.) These options reduce travel time (one long stop instead of two).

**Sample Options:**

| **Depart (Jan 2026)** | **Airline & Route** | **Stops** | **Price (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jan 14 | _LATAM Airlines_ - CTG ➔ GRU ➔ TLV (via São Paulo) | 1 stop | ~\$561[\[15\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/ctg/il/cartagena-to-israel.html#:~:text=Tel%20Aviv,Airlines%201%20stop%20from%20%24561) |
| Jan 7-13 (flexible) | _Air Europa + El Al_ - CTG ➔ MAD ➔ TLV (via Madrid) | 1 stop | ~\$780[\[17\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/tlv/ctg/tel-aviv-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Tel%20Aviv,on%20top%20of%20our%20rewards) |

**Notes:** Cartagena's airport offers limited long-haul connectivity, so most itineraries route through a major hub. An interesting alternative is **Turkish Airlines**: one could fly from Cartagena to Panama or Bogotá and connect to Turkish's Istanbul flight, then onward to Tel Aviv. This can sometimes be competitive in price and means only **1 plane change** (in Istanbul). Also, **Wingo** (a low-cost carrier) can be used for the first leg (e.g. CTG to Panamá or Bogotá) to save money[\[18\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/ctg/il/cartagena-to-israel.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20cheapest%20airline,flies%20to%20Israel%20from%20Cartagena)[\[19\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/ctg/il/cartagena-to-israel.html#:~:text=,for%20your%20Cartagena%20to%20Israel).

### Buenos Aires (Argentina) ➔ **Tel Aviv, Israel**

- **Typical routing:** Popular one-stop connections are **via Europe** - e.g. **Iberia** (Buenos Aires → Madrid → Tel Aviv) or **ITA Airways**/_El Al_ (via Rome). Also, **Ethiopian Airlines** offers one-stop service (via Addis Ababa) and **Emirates** via Dubai, among others[\[20\]\[21\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/eze/tlv/buenos-aires-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=). Travel times range ~20-24 hours.
- **Cheapest option:** The lowest one-way fares recently start around **\$820-\$830**. Expedia indicates prices **from \$826** for one-way EZE→TLV[\[22\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/eze/tlv/buenos-aires-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Buenos%20Aires,TLV). In some cases, travelers have found slightly cheaper (~\$700s) on less direct routes - e.g. Skyscanner noted ~\$703 for a Jan 29 departure with GOL Airlines (likely via Brazil)[\[23\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/buea/tlv/buenos-aires-to-ben-gurion-intl.html#:~:text=%24642%20Flights%20from%20Buenos%20Aires,A%C3%A9reas%2C%20departing%20from%20Buenos). However, for early January (peak season), **~\$800+** is a realistic budget for the cheapest seat.
- **One-stop "best value":** Expect roughly **\$900±** for a one-stop flight with a reputable carrier. For example, fares on **ITA Airways + El Al** or **Ethiopian** are often in the high \$800s. (Kayak lists options from **\$878** on airlines like ITA, Emirates, etc.[\[24\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/Buenos-Aires-Ministro-Pistarini-EZE/Tel-Aviv-Ben-Gurion-Intl-TLV#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Buenos%20Aires,KAYAK%20now%20to%20find).) These involve a single layover (Rome, Tel Aviv or Addis Ababa) and tend to minimize total travel time.

**Sample Options:**

| **Depart (Jan 2026)** | **Airline & Route** | **Stops** | **Price (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jan 10 | _Ethiopian Airlines_ - EZE ➔ ADD ➔ TLV (via Addis Ababa) | 1 stop | ~\$826[\[22\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/eze/tlv/buenos-aires-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Buenos%20Aires,TLV) |
| Jan 8 | _Iberia_ - EZE ➔ MAD ➔ TLV (via Madrid) | 1 stop | ~\$900[\[24\]](https://www.kayak.com/flight-routes/Buenos-Aires-Ministro-Pistarini-EZE/Tel-Aviv-Ben-Gurion-Intl-TLV#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Buenos%20Aires,KAYAK%20now%20to%20find) |

**Notes:** Flight options from Argentina may include _long layovers_ if aiming for the absolute cheapest fare. For example, some itineraries route **via São Paulo and Istanbul** (two stops) or even through the U.S., but those can exceed 30 hours total. Given the distance, many travelers prioritize one-stop options on this route despite a slightly higher cost. Airlines like **Ethiopian, Emirates, Turkish,** and **Air Europa** are frequently among the more affordable one-stop choices[\[25\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/eze/tlv/buenos-aires-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=)[\[26\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/eze/tlv/buenos-aires-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=Prices%20were%20available%20within%20the,Additional%20terms%20apply).

### Panama City (Panama) ➔ **Tel Aviv, Israel**

- **Typical routing:** Panama is well-connected to Europe and the U.S., so one-stop itineraries are possible via **Amsterdam (KLM)**, **Paris (Air France)**, **Madrid (Iberia/Air Europa)**, **Istanbul (Turkish)**, **Newark/New York (United/El Al)**, etc. Travel time is about 13-16 hours with one connection.
- **Cheapest option:** One-way fares in early January start around **\$525-\$540**. For example, Avianca offers one-stop service (via Bogotá) around **\$536** on Jan 12[\[27\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/pty/tlv/panama-city-tocumen-international-to-ben-gurion-intl.html#:~:text=from%20%24525). Similarly, KLM's one-stop flight (via Amsterdam) was advertised at **\$575** even on Dec 25[\[28\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/pty/tlv/panama-city-tocumen-international-to-ben-gurion-intl.html#:~:text=Avianca%201%20stop%20from%20%24536). These represent excellent deals for this route (likely basic economy fares).
- **One-stop "best value":** Around **\$700**. A Delta Airlines itinerary (via the U.S.) for Jan 10 was quoted at **\$714**[\[29\]](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/flights-from-panama-city-to-tel-aviv-yafo.html#:~:text=Find%20Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Panama,View%20flights), and United's flights via Newark tend to be in the \$800 range[\[30\]](https://www.united.com/en-us/flights-from-panama-city-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Panama%20City,924%20%C2%B7%2098). Turkish Airlines (PTY → Istanbul → TLV) can sometimes be competitive as well, often in the high \$600s if booked in advance. Choosing a single-stop route keeps the journey around 15 hours.

**Sample Options:**

| **Depart (Jan 2026)** | **Airline & Route** | **Stops** | **Price (USD)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jan 12 | _Avianca_ - PTY ➔ BOG ➔ TLV (via Bogotá) | 1 stop | ~\$536[\[27\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/pty/tlv/panama-city-tocumen-international-to-ben-gurion-intl.html#:~:text=from%20%24525) |
| Jan 10 | _Delta Airlines_ - PTY ➔ JFK ➔ TLV (via New York) | 1 stop | ~\$714[\[29\]](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/flights-from-panama-city-to-tel-aviv-yafo.html#:~:text=Find%20Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Panama,View%20flights) |

**Notes:** Panama's Tocumen (PTY) is a major hub, so **many one-stop options** exist. The **fastest** itineraries are around 13 hours (e.g. PTY-Amsterdam-TLV). If price is the priority, watch for Avianca's flights via Bogotá or combination tickets (e.g. a cheap PTY-Europe flight on KLM, then a separate Europe-TLV leg on a low-cost carrier). Historical data shows prices are lowest in January/February[\[31\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/pty/tlv/panama-city-tocumen-international-to-ben-gurion-intl.html#:~:text=Dec), which aligns well with your return timeframe. Booking about a month in advance can help lock in the best fares.

**Sources:** Flight pricing data is sourced from Google Flights, Skyscanner, Expedia, Kayak, and airline websites for the specified travel dates[\[1\]](https://www.skyscanner.com/routes/sjo/cun/san-jose-juan-santamaria-to-cancun.html#:~:text=Cancun,with%20Volaris%20Direct%20from%20%24130)[\[4\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/ctg/san-jose-to-cartagena#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,CTG)[\[8\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/sjo/eze/san-jose-to-buenos-aires#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20San%20Jos%C3%A9,EZE)[\[32\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/pty/tlv/panama-city-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Panama%20City,TLV)[\[22\]](https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/eze/tlv/buenos-aires-to-tel-aviv#:~:text=Cheap%20Flights%20from%20Buenos%20Aires,TLV). All prices are **approximate and subject to change** - they were the best available as of recent searches. It's recommended to use tools like Google Flights or Skyscanner to monitor live prices and book when a good deal appears. Safe travels!
